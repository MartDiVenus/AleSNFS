# AleSNFS
archives; a personal scientific notation  of files' size.

# Intro

alearchiver: compression of files/dirs and extraction of archives, only for
some formats.

luxdim, valedim: a my [with international backgroud] scientific notation 
of files' size.


# Interesting subjects

alearchiver: bash options, I demonstrated that it is also possibile for bash,
see 

:~$ alearchiver -h

alearchiver: vim's read(),  vim's write(),  vim's input(), in  alearchiver by 
options.

luxdim: different way  to specify  target file  by bash option,  compared  to
alearchiver.

valedim: interoperability of ValeNetrw.
